### Graceful Degradation

The acronym graceful degradation is a competitor of the progressive enhancement technique in the development process. This approach might be sound familiar with the progressive enhancement strategy but in the concerning it is completetly different. While the progressive enhancement approach tries to support base functionally in every platform and is adding features on top of it progresively, the graceful degradation approach is to develop the whole functionality and provide fallbacks and polyfills for the non supportet techniques. Moreover the problem at this approach is that everything has to be polyfilled or hacked with brutal Internet Explorer fixes – most of the time it is a tricky approach which is producing often bloated and unneccessary code.
