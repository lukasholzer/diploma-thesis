## Development Concepts


### Graceful Degradation

The acronym graceful degradation is a competitor of the progressive enhancement technique in the design and development process. This approach might be sound familiar with the progressive enhancement strategy but in the concerning, it is completely different. While the progressive enhancement approach tries to support base functionally on every platform and is adding features on top of it progressively, the graceful degradation approach is to develop the whole functionality and provide fallbacks and polyfills for the not supported techniques. Moreover, the problem with this approach is that everything has to be polyfilled or hacked with brutal Internet Explorer fixes – most of the time it is a tricky approach which is producing often bloated and unnecessary code.
