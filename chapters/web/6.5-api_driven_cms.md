## API driven CMS

When we are reaching the point of feeding the website with content there are several approaches, first we have a static site, which means, that the content is hardcoded in the template files. On the one hand a big benefit of this solution is, that it is very cost saving and for low budget projects it might be a good solution when the content isn't changing very often, but on the other hand it requires certain skills in web technologies. Obviously it often requires that some redakteurs have to learn css and it is all quite complex to maintain. This is the point where we hitting the content management system short CMS. 
The benefit of this technology is that it provides an own admin interface in the browser wehere the content of the page can be inserted with text fields and without any knowhow in webtechnologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The leading company in the field of low-price CMS is wordpress. An open-source free to use, MIT licenced product which was designed especially for blogs and newspapers. The field of the enterprice CMS solution is full of monoliths, written often by big tech company itselfs, but to mention one for example it would be ContentNode. This enterprice CMS soultions called ECMS providing a huge range of business logic or publishing stages – that is not needed on small projects. 

### Why Wordpress was not the best solution

When it leads to the decission of choosing the right CMS there are a lot of factors and variables to consider. 

API driven CMS is quite a new thing in the world and a small sector next to all static site generators or other Content Management Systems.
