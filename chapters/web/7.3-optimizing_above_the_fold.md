## Optimizing above the fold

When the word above the fold is mentioned, then frontend engineers are talking about **progressive rendering**. That means, that taking care of the performance of a page during the load is important. Furthermore, we want to display every content as soon as possible. Especially this is important for pages that are containing a lot of content and images, or where the user has a slow internet connection. But how is it possible to indicate this progress of loading, so that the user understand the rollup of the site? Times where a loading indicator with a progress bar where shown are gone. Nobody want to wait five seconds till he is able to get any information about a web page or web app. That is the reason why progressive rendering is so important. Because after the main Document – the page – is transmitted it starts to parse every line by line and rendering the content. However the problem is that if something that blocks the rendering is in the top of the page it has to wait all the time till this content is loaded and the visitor is viewing in this time a white blank screen. To avoid this behaviour there are some golden rules to consider.

### Stylesheets at the top

The first rule is to put styles to the top, in the head section of the page. Otherwise it would delay the page loading and cause the white screen issue. But concerning a large main.css where all style rules for the whole page are located in could be inefficient as well
