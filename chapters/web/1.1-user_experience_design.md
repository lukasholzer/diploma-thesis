## User Experience Design

But what is UX? If you hear the word User Experience Design you probably think about arranging objects or designing colours and graphics on the screen. But User Experience is quite different. It is more about the experience of using things. The aim is to find the easiest way of communication which is intuitive and simple. But getting on the right lane is a long progress in getting in touch with people. Knowing the target customers is the responsibility in UX design. It is important to know their habits and reactions to face their problems. Design is not about arranging objects in an aesthetically way. It is a progress of solving problems. We are all facing problems everywhere and for the most cases, there might be a solution out there. But life is not a pre-written script. It is unpredictable. There are so many edge cases out there and the goal of a good UX design is to solve as many problems as possible.
