# The technological Stack

Technology is one of the most important parts when it comes to the point of development and production. It is a combat between using a bullet proof solutions, that might be outdated, and using the fanciest and latest technologies, which are often poorly tested or not production ready. The problem is the speed, technologies are changing and updating. It is like a competition against the time. Every week there is a new major version releasing and things are goning even faster now. Maybe when writing these lines a new framework is now in production somewhere out in the world.
But what is the single and only solution? Short hint, there is no only solution. Think about all problems out there, but every problem might need a different solution. So there are no laws and rules how to tackle a specific problem it is more looking for the needs of the customer and combining them with the habbits and preferences of the developers. Finally the developer has to work and maintain these technologies. So in the ecosystem of the Altwiener Christkindlmarkt, the focus was on a modular CMS like Contentful and Storyblok. Instead of a static site generator or wordpress. On the one hand Wordpress would be pretty simple to install and their is a bunch of plugins out their, but on the other hand a CMS like Storyblok which is API driven is plattform independet. The benefit of an API driven CMS is that you can choose your stack on your own. In case of Storyblok, a JSON *(JavaScript Object Notation)* based *Application Programming* Interface is easier to handle in JavaScript as in PHP.
