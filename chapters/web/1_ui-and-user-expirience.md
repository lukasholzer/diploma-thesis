# UI und User Expirience (UX)


## Design Principles

Design Principles are the language and the environment of expressing what is right and wrong in designs. It expresses a state so that the user has the best experience at handling the design. In Web Design there is everything about usability. The main focus of web design is to archive a visitor with a long lasting attention. The user should be interested in the topics and should get the information straight forward, without clicking throught unpredictable dialogs or sections. These principles are the ruleset and the scientific laws of the usability, like the gravity law on earth. They were craftet during a long period of studying humans' behavior and understanding the environment. That is the reason why you should design for the people and not for the asthetics.

### The Principle of Proximity

The principle of proximity is based on the perception of the distance between objects. Simplified it referres to the grouping principle. Two objects, that are closer together pretend to have a relationship. In comparison two objects, that are further apart, would have less relation. In general it is a pattern system, that describse a function. Ordering objects according to each other based on the function leads to a comprehensible layout and design. With this little enhancement it is possible to generate a huge impact in improving the design.
