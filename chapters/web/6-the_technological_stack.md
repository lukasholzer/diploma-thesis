# The technological Stack

Technology is one of the most important parts when it comes to the point of development and production. It is a combat between using a bulletproof solution, which might be outdated and using the fanciest and latest technologies, which are often poorly tested or not ready for production. Fast-moving technologies that are changed and updated at high frequencies cause a severe issue. It is like a race against the time. Every week there is a new major version released, and things are going even faster then. Maybe when writing these lines a new framework is now in production somewhere out in the world.
But what is the unique solution? Short hint, there is not only one solution. Thinking about all problems out there, but every question might need a different solution. So there are no laws and rules how to tackle a particular challenge. It is rather looking for the needs of the customer and combining them with the habits and preferences of the developers. Finally, the developer has to work and maintain these technologies. So in the ecosystem of the Altwiener Christkindlmarkt, the focus was on a modular CMS like Contentful and Storyblok. Instead of a static site generator or WordPress. On the one hand, WordPress would be pretty simple to install, and a bunch of plugins would be available out there. On the contrary, a CMS like Storyblok which is API driven is platform independent. The benefit of an API driven CMS is that you can choose your stack on your own. In the case of Storyblok, a JSON *(JavaScript Object Notation)* based *Application Programming* Interface is easier to handle in JavaScript as in PHP.
