## What is HTML5

If you talk about HTML5, you talk about a Hyper Text Mark Language short HTML. In general, it is like a structuring language for content. In other words, you describe the content. You tell the interpreter so that this line of code is a headline of the first section or this area is a sidebar. The interpreter, in many cases a modern web browser can handle these markup and render it. HTML5 is a superseding of HTML4 and all previous versions of HTML. It is kind of the *next generation of HTML*, so it is the scaffolding for a new way of web application and websites. To conclude HTML5 takes advantage of new features which are shifting the way of browser experience. To sum some up HTML5 is cross-platform compatible, so all you need is a modern web browser that can interpret these new tags and definitions. Despite the fact it is a new way of a formal documentation for unwritten standards in most browsers. So it was a shift for developers to rely on new features in a way that every browser interpret these features according to a standard. HTML5 brings some new features as well. Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>` or `<article>`. Geolocation, a persistent local storage, offline web applications or even microdata to extend the vocabulary of HTML5 with custom semantics.

Turning to the point that you want to use HTML5 features on the web application. The question, can I use HTML5 on my web page is misleading, probably HTML5 is not one big thing, it is a collection of features and some browsers only supporting a variety of features, like certain tags or video elements. Obviously, it is possible to detect the support of those features. But getting familiar with the detection techniques it is necessary to get familiar with the Document Object Model short DOM.

### The DOM

So what is the Document Object Model? It is not the source code you write in a .html file. Therefore the DOM is the result of your source code parsed by the browser, even though it is not the source code if you click in your browser on View Source. As can be expected View Source shows you exact the HTML that makes up the page. If you want to have a look at the DOM you need to inspect the site with the developer tools. There you get a brief overview of all document nodes. You can click on them and expand them. so it is like a box model where every box is wrapped in another box. So if you want to manipulate the DOM during runtime of a page – in the case of user interaction – you have to take advantage of JavaScript. You can fetch some DOM-Nodes or Single Nodes with a simple `document.querySelector('container');` This would return the first Node of type container. Now you can store this node in a variable and manipulate it.

In other words, JavaScript is a language the browser can understand and interpret. On the contrary, there is the DOM – the place where the magic happens. So facing this two arguments you can say JavaScript is a DOM accessing and manipulation language where you can watch events, attached to some DOM nodes. In other words, you can give a button a click event that executes a function when the button is pressed.

"The (…) DOM is an application programming interface (API) (…) It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated."
> W3C: What is the Document Object Model – https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html, 10.03.2017

In point of detection techniques for HTML5 features, we are accessing the `window` or `navigator` Object and testing if the property for the particular feature is available in this context. For this kind of testing, there is an HTML5 detection library called Modernizr. It is open source and under the MIT-licence and detects the support for HTML5 and CSS3 features. It is important that you include this script in the `<head>` Tag of the page. This is important because you need it before the DOM is built up so that you can check the support of the features. This is possible because page rendering is blocked until the script is loaded and executed.

### Using HTML5 tags and getting rid of the boxing hell

If you look back in the early beginnings of HTML and the web, HTML was only a structuring language like XML or maybe Markdown. It was like you had a site where you place your text in a word document and that was it. Of course, it was possible to change the background colour or the font family. But in the beginning of web HTML was not considered to be used for special layouts and arranging objects on the page. Although one essential feature like tables where used misleading and not the way they meant. Tables were considered for tables (nothing else), besides the fact that using tables is only a good option if you want to display a score table or something that fits into a table. However, you have to consider that tables in a responsive fluid layout are always a curse. 
But developers struggled a lot with the layout problem till the float was invented in CSS 2.1. Now it was possible to float containers and position them. The ultimate change came in the HTML version 4 where a new container occurred. The div element was born. HTML4 came with a lot of breaking changes and one of them was a normal box without any additional styling. It was like a LEGO Box, where it was possible to nest things deeper and deeper. As can be expected this was the point where maintainability of websites was even more crucial as before. The problem was the end of the closing divs. That was the point where you had a tree with 10 closing divs at the and – that was a pleasure to figure out which one was the correct one. In the same way, it was even harder for search engines or crawlers to get semantical information about the page. Obviously, all important information about a page was then put in the meta information in the head section of a page. In other words, people wrote a huge list of any information only in the keywords section to be better rated at google. In this case, it was hard to find the right page over a search engine because so much misleading information was given to the search robots. 
God blesses the invention of HTML5, now it was possible to build a semantical correct page and the google bots could focus on retrieving the information directly from the page without concentrating on wrong keywords or meta descriptions.
Furthermore, it was a bless for developers, as it was way easier to figure out what the content describes a header was a header tag and not a div with a class name.
The following example shows the difference in the closing tag. The starting tag is maybe easier to read but the real benefit is the closing tag where you see immediately that the header is closed.

**without HTML5 syntax**

``` html

  <div class="header">
    <h1>My Header</h1>
  </div>

``` 

**with HTML5 syntax**

``` html

  <header>
    <h1>My Header</h1>
  </header>

``` 

For structuring the page sections instead of div elements following new containers were created to enhance the semantic of the document. The `<section>` node created to describe a section in a document. In a section, it is recommended to structure the text in so-called `<article>` nodes. In contrast, an article node could contain a variety of section elements. These article nodes are describing a stand-alone content, that can be independently from the rest of the page.  In addition, there was a tag for a sidebar `<aside>`, that is very common in blog or newspaper layouts. As well for navigations, the `<nav>` tag was invented that can only contain navigation links.

### The HTML5 Storage

Heading up to part of storing data it is necessary to know, that storing key/value pairs in browsers was a crucial thing before the introduction of the so-called Web Storage – some browsers are referring to it as the "Local Storage" or "DOM Storage". Looking to the historical part of storing elements in the browser cookies seemed as a good solution in this days. On the one hand it seemed like a good idea storing data persistent even after navigating away from the site or closing the browser, but on the other hand, it is unlike with cookies. You have to send it manually if you want to transmit it to the remote web server.
Considering the use of the local storage you need not be aware of using it, accordingly, the browser support is amazing if you check the Table.
