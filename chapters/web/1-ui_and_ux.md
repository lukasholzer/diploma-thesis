# UI and UX design

The acronyms UI and UX are quite common in modern web discussions – is is like the basic scaffolding of a modern web page or web app. These acronyms representing the words User Interface and User Experience Design. Nowadays it is more important to take a deeper look at the functionality of websites instead of beautiful arranging objects and shapes on the page. It is a combat between functionality and aesthetics. This combat is foughten with weapons like user stories and corporate design guidelines. The problem on many pages is the accessibility of the pages. Considering the average time a user is spending on a website, is getting shorter and shorter. If he does not get the information he wants, then he is looking for a different page one on Google. That is the point where a page lost a returning user and a returning user reaches and through reach and at last cash. These obstacles are often uncomfortable behaviours – stretching the thumb to the left upper corner – that a user has to perform on a mobile device. As well on desktops, there could be restrictions to clicking through an overlay hell or trying to get some information through unpredictable scroll behaviours. These actions often restricting the accessibility a lot, and we are not talking either about accessibility in programming. These obstacles are often done in the design. For this reason, a good User Experience design is the key to the whole success story.
