# UI and UX design

The acronyms UI and UX are quite common in modern web discussions – it is like the basic scaffolding of a modern web page or web app. These acronyms represent the words User Interface and User Experience Design. Nowadays it is more important to take a deeper look at the functionality of websites instead of beautifully arranging objects and shapes on the page. It is a combat between functionality and aesthetics. This combat is fought with weapons like user stories and corporate design guidelines. The problem on many pages is the accessibility of the pages. Considering the average time a user is spending on a website, the duration is getting shorter and shorter. If the user does not get the information he wants, then he is looking for a different page one on Google. That is the point where a page loses a returning user and a returning user means cash. These obstacles are often uncomfortable behaviours, that a user has to perform on a mobile device. Like stretching the thumb to the left upper corner. As well on desktops, there could be restrictions to clicking through an overlay hell or trying to get some information through unpredictable scroll behaviours. These actions often restrict the accessibility a lot, and we are not talking even about accessibility in programming. These obstacles are often done in the design. For this reason, a good User Experience design is the key to the whole success story.
