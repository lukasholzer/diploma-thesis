## Design Principles

Design Principles are the language and the environment of expressing what is right and wrong in designs. It expresses a state so that the user has the best experience at handling the design. In Web Design, there is everything about usability. The main focus of web design is to archive a visitor with a long lasting attention. The user should be interested in the topics and should get the information straight forward, without clicking through unpredictable dialogues or sections. These principles are the rule sets and the scientific laws of the usability, like the gravity law on earth. They were crafted during a long period of studying humans‘ behaviour and understanding the environment. That is the reason why you should design for the people and not for the aesthetic.

### The Principle of Proximity

The principle of proximity is based on the perception of the distance between objects. Simplified its references to the grouping principle. Two objects, that are closer together pretend to have a relationship. In comparison, two objects that are further apart would have less relation. In general, it is a pattern system, that describes a function. Ordering objects according to each other based on the function lead to a comprehensible layout and design. With this little enhancement, it is possible to generate a huge impact in improving the design. Think about frustrated and confused users, who are not able to get any kind of information in case of a misleading arrangement of objects and how they are organised. The solution is a clear and well-considered layout that puts less strain on users to find the information they need.
