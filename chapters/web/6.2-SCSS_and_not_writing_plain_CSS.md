## CSS and SCSS

When we are heading to the point of styling our page, CSS is the only solution. CSS *(Cascading Style Sheets)* is a language written on top of HTML to markup tags and control the layout and design of web page. If you were surfing the web in the year of 1995 and having a look at the websites of this period, you will probably recognize, that CSS was not invented yet. The pages consist out of a straight line orientated layout with any styles. Thank God now we have the third major version of CSS and we are facing the beta version of CSS4. Accordingly, we are hitting a point where CSS might be magical for you in fact of all possibilities. To begin let us start with the benefits CSS brought to a sluggish web page. First of all, with CSS, we have the choice to format text, paragraphs and headlines. You are able to change the font family, the size, the font weight and even the letter spacing – like we are used from print publishing tools like InDesign. In addition, it is possible to indent paragraphs or apply drop caps to them, in other words, you can style them like a magazine layout. The next useful point is with CSS you get the ability to arrange Objects – in our case divs and HTML5 tags – to provide a box model layout. In old days this was hacked with the float property – like the HTML tables, the float property was not meant for this, it was provided for text floats around images.

Nevertheless, the web and particular CSS got the *Flexbox Layout* shortly flexbox. This new feature aims to be more efficient in the way to layout and align items with distributing space in a container. The most important benefit of this property is that it can be applied even if the size is unknown or dynamic. This is a huge benefit in responsive and fluid layouts and was a shift in so-called flexible Layouts. It is possible that containers expand automatically to fill free space or shrink them to prevent overflows. In other words, it provides a flexible layout for any kind of device or screen size. The main goal of flexbox was to arrange small-scale layouts within a grid component. Even though the CSS grid is in production and not supported in every browser – flexbox is used for grids as well in the moment. The flexbox properties are well supported now (Internet Explorer 11+ and all other major browsers) and giving us a new dimension in arranging objects in the way it is meant to.

### Anatomy of a Style Declaration

To understand the functionality of CSS it is important to now that CSS is not a programming language. Instead, it is a declaration based markup, that describes with a selector and a declaration block, which adjectives should be applied on these elements, selected with the selector. Often this kind of style declaration is easy to understand, as it is similar to English, for example, take a look at following style rule. `p { color: black, font-family: Henriette,  font-size: 1em }`. This example describes the properties for a standard paragraph, "Make the text black and take the font Henriette and make it 1em tall". So It is pretty clear what is going on there.

If you take a deeper look at the previous declaration you will see that it is built out of certain components. First of all, we need the selector, that tells the browser which element or elements on a page to select – in our case, it was a paragraph. The next element is the declaration block, you can identify it with an opening curly brace and with a closing curly brace. Inside this declaration block, you will see the list of declarations for the selected element. A declaration consists out of a key value pair. As can be expected, a Property like `font-size` and a value. This value can be a string, number, hexadecimal colour like `#333333` or an URL like `url('./images/background.jpg')`. Important is only that a key: value pair ends with a semicolon so that the browser recognises that a statement is finished. As the browser trims all whitespaces and tabs, that are used for formatting the styles.

### How to include Style Declarations

Obviously, a single style rule won't transform the page into a masterpiece of art. For writing code that transforms the page the way you imagined, it is necessary to include a collection of style rules and declarations.   When we are heading to the point of including our styles on the web page there are three options. First of all, there is the option of writing styles directly in a tag like: `<p style="font-size: 16px">Text</p>`. This options is not really recommended and takes only place in styling e-mail templates. The two options, that are important for the web, are the internal or the external style sheet. 
> cf. Sawyer McFarland - CSS3 – the missing manual, p.39 – 40.

The state of art at including styles in a web page is the external stylesheet. This options consists out of a .css file which is loaded with a link tag like the following example: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css" />`. The previous example takes to arguments a rel attribute, that defines the type of the content – a stylesheet – and the href attribute that takes an absolute or relative URL to the located file. The advantage of this solution is the cache factor. Normally this file would cause an HTTP Request and every HTTP Request slows down our site. But with a service worker, it is possible to store this file in the service worker storage so that the browser can cache it. To prevent old cache issues if something is changed a version number is provided to the file so that the browser knows, if the version number is changing it should request the file again.
> cf. Ebd., p.40 – 41.

Even though the benefits of external stylesheets, are great with the caching factor, but the second option of the internal stylesheet has some benefits as well. This internal styles are written inside a `<style></style>` tag, that is located in the `<head>` section of the page. Obviously, this has to be in the head area, because this information is needed before the page is rendered so that the page is going to be rendered with these style information. For that reason, this technique is used for optimising the page for Googles above the fold. That means you provide all information for the visible area of the first 1080px of the page in an inline tag. Even though good developers do not write this code directly in the head section it is rendered in this section during the built process where all prerequisites are going to be concatenated and uglified and minimised.
